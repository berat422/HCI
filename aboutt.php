                <h1 >WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?</h1>
                <p style="color:gray">MENTAL HEALTH IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR OVERALL WELLNESS. ACCORDING TO WHO (WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION), MENTAL HEALTH IS DEFINED AS “A STATE OF WELL-BEING IN WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL REALIZES HIS OR HER POTENTIAL, CAN COPE WITH THE NORMAL STRESSES OF LIFE, CAN WORK PRODUCTIVELY AND FRUITFULLY, AND CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO HER OR HIS COMMUNITY.” WHEN YOU HAVE STABLE MENTAL HEALTH, YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE. AS HUMAN BEINGS, TO REACH A STATE OF STABILITY AND BALANCE, IT’S CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE GOOD MENTAL HEALTH. PART OF THAT IS AWARENESS, AND KNOWING OURSELVES. WHEN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS STABLE, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN MANAGE THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE CHALLENGES YOU ENCOUNTER. ONE WAY TO MAINTAIN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS TO HAVE A STABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM, AND SEE A THERAPIST EVERY WEEK. YOU MIGHT HAVE ANXIOUS MOMENTS, BUT YOU CAN WORK THROUGH THEM. WHEN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH IS OUT OF BALANCE, YOU CAN SUFFER FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR MENTAL ILLNESS.</p> 
                <h1 >MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES</h1>
                <p style="color:green">ACCORDING TO NAMI (NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS), ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES LIVES WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS. AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MANAGE TO LIVE PRODUCTIVE LIVES. WHETHER YOU MANAGE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER, PTSD, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, BIPOLAR DISORDER, BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER OR ANY OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN, YOU CAN GET TREATMENT AND FIND A SENSE OF BALANCE REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU’RE MANAGING. THE KEY IS TO GET TREATMENT AS SOON AS YOU RECOGNIZE WHAT YOUR PROBLEMS ARE. SOME PEOPLE REFER TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS “MENTAL DISORDERS” OR “MENTAL ILLNESS.” THE STIGMA SURROUNDING MENTAL ILLNESS IS PREVALENT, AND PEOPLE ARE HESITANT TO CALL DIAGNOSES ILLNESSES BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT TO ADMIT THAT IT’S AN AILMENT. THEY MIGHT FEEL LIKE THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM.</p>
                <h1 >TREATMENT</h1>
                <p style="color:gray">THERE ARE VARIOUS TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE’S MENTAL HEALTH JOURNEY IS DIFFERENT. WHAT WORKS FOR YOU MIGHT NOT WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE. ONE OF THE MOST COMMONS TREATMENTS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS OR WHEN SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS PSYCHOTHERAPY.</p>
                <h1>MEDICATION</h1>
                <p style="color:green"> SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS TAKE PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION. IF YOU LIVE WITH A CHRONIC CONDITION SUCH AS BIPOLAR DISORDER, PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION COULD DRASTICALLY IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE. CONSIDER CONSULTING WITH A PSYCHIATRIST IF YOU’RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDICINE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT PSYCHIATRY IN THE ADVICE SECTION.

THERE ARE SOME MENTAL ILLNESSES CAN DO WELL WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL TAKES MEDICATION AND GOES TO THERAPY. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION CAN HELP PEOPLE MAINTAIN STABLE MENTAL HEALTH.</p>
